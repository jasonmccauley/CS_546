            <h2>The City That Never Sleeps</h2>
            <cite>March 12, 2024</cite>
            <p>Game day at Yankees stadium! The atmosphere started off electric, as the Yankees faced the Red Sox on Sunday night baseball. Unfortunately, we were shutout... Before the game however, I did get to try a chopped cheese at General Ock's Deli -- the ocky way!</p>
            <p>We also got to enjoy a walk through the bustling time square, where the lights are always bright. Making our way to Central Park, it was a serene but busy start to our day in the city.</p>

            <h2>You're a Wizard, Jason!</h2>
            <cite>June 18, 2024</cite>
            <p>I finally got to experience the Wizarding World of Harry Potter! Drinking butterbeer in Hogsmeade, staring at the Hogwarts Castle was surreal -- I felt like a character in the book, a childhood dream come true. The attention to detail is unreal, from the many shops in Diagon Alley to the restaurants that Harry and his friends often visited.</p>
            <p>The new Gringotts ride was fun, but the highlight of my day was definitely eating at the Three Broomsticks with my family. We finished the day by taking the Hogwarts Express between the parks.</p>

            <h2>A Day at Broadway</h2>
            <cite>August 15, 2024</cite>
            <p>We spent the day exploring the shops of Broadway at the Beach in Myrtle Beach. The weather was perfect -- hot enough to walk around but not uncomfortable. I got to enjoy some local seafood while watching boats race around on the lake. The atmosphere is a complete 180 from the Murrells Inlet I visited earlier in my trip -- much busier, but lots of things to keep busy with.</p>
            <p>The evening was spent roaming through Ripley's Aquarium. The shark tunnel was sick! Seeing these giant sharks swim overhead while surrounded by the rest of the aquarium was unforgettable. With the sun being a bit stronger tomorrow, I'll certainly make my way to the beach.</p>

            <h2>The Steel City</h2>
            <cite>September 7, 2024</cite>
            <p>Watching the Steelers play at Heinz Field was quite the experience! Even as a Giants fan, I had to marvel at the sea of terrible towels, waving as my team was crushed. It's completely different than the atmosphere at MetLife. After the game, we grabbed food at Peppi's -- I got to try the famous Roethlisberger, and it definitely lived up to the hype.</p>
            <p>Before the game, we got to take the Duquesne Incline up for a marvelous view of the city and its three rivers. Between the beautiful Point State Park fountain and the giant yellow bridges, Pittsburgh truly has a geography like no other, and to me is what sets it apart from the other cities I've visited. Looking forward to checking out the Pittsburgh Zoo tomorrow!</p>

            <h2>Boston Tea Party</h2>
            <cite>September 12, 2024</cite>
            <p>This morning, we started our Boston adventure by visiting Harvard Square. The architecture was historic and also academic, as I ran into many college students like myself, preparing for the semester of hard work that lies ahead. After a meal, we headed to Boston Tea Party Ships & Museum, where we got to walk on a ship in the harbor. Experiencing this American history firsthand was truly fascinating and revolutionary, if you will!</p>
            <p>We finished the day by watching the Yankees absolutely destroy the Red Sox at the legendary Fenway Park. Although I didn't catch a home run on the Green Monster, I got to watch Giancarlo Stanton hit an absolute moonshot out of the stadium. That ball must've gone atleast 470 feet! Tomorrow we will shift the excitement from sports to explore the Museum of Fine Arts.</p>
