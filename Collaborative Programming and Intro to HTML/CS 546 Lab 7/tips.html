            <li>
                <h3>Plan Around Game Days</h3>
                <p>When visiting cities such as New York, Pittsburgh, or Boston, check the sports schedules in advance. Game days can massively affect hotel prices and availability, especially near Fenway Park and Heinz Field.</p>
                <p>Personally, I would recommend booking in neighborhoods slightly away from stadiums, even if it means driving 30 minutes to get there. If you are planning to attend a game, book well in advance, especially for rivalry matches. If not, plan your trip around game days if possible to avoid the crowds, traffic, and higher prices.</p>

                <h3>Local Food Experience</h3>
                <p>Each city has its local spots that you have to try. You can't miss General Ock's Deli in New York City for the most authentic bodega experience, or Peppi's in Pittsburgh for a sandwich experience like no other. In Boston and Myrtle Beach, you have to give the local seafood a try!</p>
                <p>I would recommend asking locals for their favorite spots -- sometimes the best restaurants are the ones you won't find from a Google search, or are not the expected tourist spots!</p>

                <h3>Transportation Tips</h3>
                <p>In cities such as New York and Boston, public transportation will be your best friend! If you plan to stay for several days, take advantage of weekly passes, as they can get you pretty much anywhere you need to be.</p>
                <p>In Orlando and Myrtle Beach, public transportation is not quite an option, so you may need a rental car. You may want to check if your hotel offers a shuttle or transportation service to major attractions, especially for staying in Orlando. Often times, these can help you avoid the parking fees and traffic.</p>

                <h3>Theme Park Strategy</h3>
                <p>For Orlando's theme parks, arrive as early as you can so that you have time to ride each of the most popular attractions, such as Space Mountain, or Hagrid's Motorbike Adventure. If it's within your budget, and you would like to visit multiple parks in one day, consider a Park Hopper pass. This will allow you to visit both Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade in the same day at Universal.</p>
                <p>Download park apps to get an idea of wait times for each ride, so that you're not spending a majority of your day waiting in line. Also, aim to make dining reservations hours in advance, especially for popular restaurants such as Victoria & Albert's or Jiko.</p>

                <h3>Timing Beach Towns</h3>
                <p>When visiting beach towns, such as Myrtle Beach, take the time of year into consideration. Spring and fall months still offer perfect beach weather, but with a smaller crowd. Visit Broadway at the Beach and Barefoot Landing during the evening for a cooler walking experience and a beautiful sunset view.</p>
                <p>For a quieter, more local experience, head to Murrells Inlet early in the morning. The crowds are much smaller and you can see some truly unique wildlife during this time of day.</p>
